## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **A large MCP connector result no longer floods the context window or the
  database.** A connector is untrusted and can return an arbitrarily large text
  blob or a multi-megabyte base64 image/file; previously the text was clamped for
  the model but the *full* result (including whole media blobs) was still
  persisted to Postgres and re-sent to the model every turn — real cost, and a big
  enough blob could trip the reactive `context_too_long` recovery. Now every MCP
  result is bounded at the moment it is produced: oversized **text** is parked in
  the session workspace (`/workspace/.capka/output/mcp/`, off-disk via the
  controller file API — no container needed) and the model gets a clamped view
  that points at the file to `read_file`/grep, exactly like the sandbox
  capture-to-file logs; an oversized **image/audio/file** blob (over
  `MAX_MCP_MEDIA_BYTES`, default 5 MB) is likewise parked and replaced with a
  text pointer the model can process programmatically (OCR/ffprobe/convert)
  instead of being inlined. Tune with `MAX_MCP_MEDIA_BYTES` and the existing
  `MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_CHARS`.
- **MCP tool descriptions are now capped** at `MAX_MCP_TOOL_DESC_CHARS` (default
  1024) before they reach the model. Some servers ship enormous per-tool
  descriptions that tax the context of *every* call before any tool even runs.
- The "update available" banner is now **dismissible** — a close button hides it
  and remembers the release, so it stays gone for that version but returns when a
  newer one ships (it previously reappeared on every page load with no way to
  silence it).
- Release notes on **Settings → Updates** now render as Markdown (via the same
  renderer the chat uses) instead of raw preformatted text, and the "how to update"
  hint is trimmed.

### Fixed
- **The context-window "full" meter and auto-compaction no longer overstate usage
  on multi-step turns.** A turn that makes several LLM calls (a tool-calling loop)
  re-reads the same growing prefix from cache on every step; `usage.input`/
  `usage.cached` correctly sum that across steps for cost and the (i) popover, but
  the context meter and the compaction trigger were reusing the same cumulative
  sum to represent "how full is the window" — so a 9-step turn could show up to 9x
  its real size, and compaction could fire well before the window was actually
  full. Both now key off the last step's actual prompt size instead.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Completes the gVisor egress fix** (0.1.2 was still partial). Two more pieces,
  both automatic — **no config/env change needed**:
  - iptables-legacy needs a writable lock, but the sandbox rootfs is read-only and
    `/run` isn't a writable mount, so the firewall died on `/run/xtables.lock`. The
    controller now points it at the writable `/tmp` tmpfs (`XTABLES_LOCKFILE`),
    set automatically only when egress is on.
  - a crashed sandbox container left its fixed name behind, so recreating the
    session failed with a 409 name conflict forever. The controller now
    force-removes the stale husk and retries.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Sandbox egress under gVisor no longer kills every container.** With
  `SANDBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK=true` on the `runsc` profile, the fail-closed egress
  firewall (added in 0.1.0) could not install its iptables rules and exited the
  container the instant it started — so every command failed. Three pieces were
  needed: the image pins iptables to the **legacy** backend gVisor speaks (not
  nft); the controller grants the sandbox **NET_RAW** alongside NET_ADMIN so the
  rules' `filter` table can initialize under `CapDrop: ALL`; and
  `scripts/install-gvisor.sh` registers the runtime with **`--net-raw=true`** so
  gVisor honors that capability. **Existing gVisor hosts must re-run the install
  script (or add `--net-raw=true` to the runsc `runtimeArgs`) and reload Docker.**
- Controller now recovers from a present-but-stopped sandbox container, not only a
  removed one: a stale handle is invalidated so the session is recreated instead of
  looping on "container is not running".

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-01

Partial gVisor egress fix (legacy iptables backend in the image + the
`--net-raw=true` install step) — **superseded by 0.1.2**, which adds the missing
`NET_RAW` container capability without which the firewall still fails. Use 0.1.2.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

> **⚠ Breaking — sandbox network egress is now fail-closed.** Sandboxes have
> **no outbound network** unless you explicitly set `SANDBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK=true`.
> Deployments that relied on sandboxes reaching the internet (package installs,
> scraping, outbound API calls from agent code) **must add this variable** or that
> traffic silently stops. This closes an egress-by-default hole; opt back in only
> if you understand the exposure (see `SECURITY.md`).

### Added
- AGPL-3.0 license; `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, CLA.
- One-variable automatic HTTPS via the Caddy TLS overlay (`DOMAIN=…`).
- Railway and Coolify deploy templates.
- Postgres backup/restore scripts and an optional scheduled-backup overlay.
- `CAPKA_VERSION` image pinning and an upgrade runbook (`docs/UPGRADE.md`).
- `ee/` boundary reserved for the commercial edition.
- Marketplace install review: every plugin install is **pinned to a concrete git
  commit** (provenance recorded), all third-party code execution is **disabled by
  default** pending admin review, and upgrades show a **file-level diff bound to the
  reviewed commit** before the pin is moved.
- Boot-time configuration audit: misconfigured/missing env (master key,
  `DATABASE_URL`, public URL, numeric knobs) is surfaced as one block at startup.
- A Content-Security-Policy (the inline-safe slice: `object-src`, `base-uri`,
  `form-action`, `frame-ancestors`).

### Changed
- The host-agnostic `docker-compose.yml` is now the canonical compose; the
  Coolify variant moved to `docker-compose.coolify.yml` (no longer auto-selected).
- `docker compose pull` now fetches the sandbox image from GHCR too.
- Sandbox image: base image is an overridable `UBUNTU_REF` arg and the duckdb/yq
  CLIs are pinned to explicit versions (were `releases/latest`, non-reproducible).

### Security
- **Sandbox egress fail-closed** behind `SANDBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK` (see breaking note
  above); the egress firewall refuses to start if its rules can't be verified.
- Governance `ask` now fails **safe** (deny) instead of allowing.
- SSRF guard broadened (0.0.0.0 / multicast / IPv6) and strips `Authorization`/
  `Cookie` on cross-host redirects; the private-range block is threaded into the
  inference fetch path. (Full DNS-rebind IP-pinning is still pending — see
  `SECURITY.md` → Known limitations.)
- Zip uploads get a decompression-bomb guard: entries inflate under a hard
  `maxOutputLength` cap, so a lying header can't expand a small upload to gigabytes.
- Foreign keys + money-column precision added (`drizzle/0034`, `0035`); audit log
  extended to admin role/status/remove, auth-config, and master-key actions.
- Billing holds are always released (try/finally); first-run setup can no longer be
  hijacked to self-promote admin; pending accounts are rejected centrally.
- Dependency advisories pinned where a non-breaking fix exists: `postcss` ≥8.5.10
  (CSS-stringify XSS) and `dompurify` ≥3.4.11 via `overrides` (was 12 prod
  advisories, now the remainder are dev-tooling only — see `SECURITY.md`).
- Account status is fail-closed (only "active" grants access); marketplace upgrade
  consent is fail-closed (must target the reviewed commit); MCP connector mutations
  require an approved account; one billing hold per task (partial unique index);
  marketplace raw fetches and catalog size are byte/count-capped.
- **Production master key is fail-closed**: with `NODE_ENV=production` and no
  `CAPKA_MASTER_KEY`, the app now refuses to start rather than silently storing the
  key in the DB. Set `CAPKA_MASTER_KEY` (recommended) or `ALLOW_DB_MASTER_KEY=true`
  to knowingly keep the insecure fallback. (`npm run up` already generates the env
  key, so turnkey deploys are unaffected.)
- HSTS is now sent by the platform too, not only the Caddy TLS profile.
